Yeah.
Nope.
No juice.
Thanks for asking.
I'm just here so I won't get fined.
I'm just 'bout that action, boss.
Nope. That's what I got today: "nope."
(Inaudible.)
I'm thankful.
You know why I'm here.
I ain't never seen no talking winning nothing.
All the unnecessary talk, it don't do nothing for me. I appreciate that people want to hear from me, but I just go to work and do my thing. You feel me?
I'm going to get mine more than I get got.
For this next three minutes, I'll just be looking at y'all the way y'all are looking at me.
I told y'all, I'm not about to say nothing.
